The brokerage expects one to two additional price increases given that domestic steel prices have increased by around 10% over the last three weeks and are still below import pricing."

The CEO justified this potential government and corporate seizure of public property, saying, \"we simply are not getting the adequate investments fast enough for grid, solar, wind and pipeline initiatives.\"\n  He concluded his letter's statement on climate change, saying, \"Polarization, paralysis and basic lack of analysis cannot keep us from addressing one of the most complex challenges of our time. In his letter, which touted the successes of the financial services company in 2022 as well as providing shareholders a vision for its future, Dimon made the case that it might be time to justify eminent domain in America to ease the climate crisis."
