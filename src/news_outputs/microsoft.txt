The tech company said Thursday it agreed to buy credits from startup Heirloom Carbon for the removal of up to 315,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide over 10 years. Early this year, the company said carbon it removed from the air was successfully stored in concrete by a Canadian startup called CarbonCure, an industry first. Oil company Occidental Petroleum also has committed billions of dollars to carbon removal and recently said it would acquire direct-air capture technology startup Carbon Engineering for about $1.1 billion. As with wind and solar energy, Microsoft expects carbon removal will see technology improvements and cost reductions over time, said Brian Marrs, the company\u2019s senior director of energy and carbon.",
