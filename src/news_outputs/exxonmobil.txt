Research into the actions of the fossil fuel industry also informed the recent US House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform's investigation, which in turn has revealed new evidence of the oil and gas industry's ongoing deception\n  As more and more evidence accumulates showing that ExxonMobil and other major fossil fuel companies had substantial knowledge of the harmful climate effects of their products and yet continued to manufacture doubt about climate science while increasing fossil fuel production and lobbying to block climate action, calls for accountability are bound to grow even louder.\n   New research by Geoffrey Supran, Stefan Rahmstorf, and Naomi Oreskes published in Science looks at the climate projections from ExxonMobil's internal scientific research and compares them to the observed temperature rise and to previous work analyzing the company's deceptive statements on climate science. Supran and his colleagues compellingly summarize the research, concluding: \u201cAll told, ExxonMobil was aware of contemporary climate science, contributed to that science, and predicted future global warming correctly.\u201d\n  3) ExxonMobil predicted the possibility of linking rising temperatures to fossil fuels\n  ExxonMobil researchers accurately predicted when it would become possible to attribute changes in climate to human activity.
