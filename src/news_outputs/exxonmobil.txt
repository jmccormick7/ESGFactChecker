The documents could bolster legal efforts to hold oil companies accountable for their alleged attempts to sow doubt about climate science.",

The fuels are \u201cvery much at the test phase\u201d and would require government policy support before becoming commercially available, Madden said. \u201cHaving a solution for liquid fuels that we can use in the existing fleet, having it in the kind of policy construct where we allow the market to innovate, is the lowest cost way to decarbonize transportation.\u201d",

            "summary": "Shares of\u00a0Denbury Resources\u00a0(DEN 6.82%) rocketed in recent weeks. The company's capture and sequestration activities enable it to offset about a quarter of the emissions produced from its oil output, giving its production much lower carbon intensity.\u00a0 \n\n Instead, what Denbury brings to the table is extensive expertise in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Shares of the oil company focused on utilizing carbon dioxide have spiked more than 60% from their bottom in late July, fueled by acquisition speculation and higher oil prices.\u00a0\n\n It could build off that company's expensive infrastructure and expertise to enhance its lower carbon oil ambitions.",

(Nasdaq: FCEL) has received an order from ExxonMobil for long-lead fuel cell stack module equipment and engineering support required to implement a potential demonstration of modular point source carbon capture at an ExxonMobil facility. \u201cFuelCell Energy continues to gain confidence in achieving large scale commercialization of FuelCell Energy's carbonate technology for industrial and commercial point source carbon capture. The commercial demonstration project is anticipated to be a full scale prototype of the modules used in large-scale systems for industrial and commercial point source carbon capture applications.\n  \u201cWe see market demand across various commercial and industrial segments to scale and commercialize our unique carbon capture solution, which captures carbon dioxide from various exhaust streams, while generating additional power and hydrogen. We believe that this technology will address one of the largest environmental challenges of today, CO emissions from industrial and commercial exhaust streams and power generation,\u201d said Jason Few, President and Chief Executive Officer of FuelCell Energy.",
