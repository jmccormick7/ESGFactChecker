            "summary": "A Thursday presentation by BP on a proposed Indiana carbon dioxide capture and sequestration project in Indiana elicited a skeptical response from those in attendance. The rock deposits under Lake County don't meet the criteria, BP representatives said, so carbon dioxide produced by industrial sites in the area would need to be piped south to more suitable injection sites in other Indiana counties. Project manager Ed Shahady told the Post-Tribune that BP is targeting 40 million tons of carbon emitted annually by industrial sites in Northwest Indiana.\n   BP plans to capture carbon dioxide emitted by industrial sites before piping it in a liquid state to injection sites for underground storage. The process requires rock deposits that are porous enough to allow carbon dioxide to spread out from the injection site and deep enough to prevent it from seeping upwards into the groundwater supply.",
