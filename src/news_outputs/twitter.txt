            "summary": "Lies about climate change on Twitter escalated to unprecedented levels this year, according to new analyses. There have been more tweets and retweets \u201cusing climate-sceptic terminology\u201d in 2022 than in any other year since Twitter\u2019s founding in 2006, according to analysis conducted for The Times by City, University of London researchers. Nevertheless, misinformation about climate change exploded on Twitter in November as delegates from across the world met for a key United Nations climate conference. Meanwhile, actual climate scientists and experts are weighing leaving Twitter, The Guardian reports, as the platform fails to moderate harmful content. The unnerving rise of content that rejects widely accepted climate science \u2014\u00a0sometimes referred to as climate skepticism or climate denial \u2014 piles on top of growing concerns about misinformation and hateful content that\u2019s proliferated since Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of the social media platform."
