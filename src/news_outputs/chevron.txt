The complaint filed in state court makes New Jersey the latest state or municipality to target major oil companies in an attempt to force them to help pay for the damages incurred by the severe weather made worse by climate change.   Dozens of similar suits have been filed across the country in recent years claiming the companies knew for decades about the dangers of burning oil and gas, but instead engaged in deceptive campaigns to sustain the market for fossil fuels.   \u201cNew Jersey is ground zero for some of the worst impacts of climate change,\u201d said Shawn LaTourette, the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, in a statement.   Oil companies are currently seeking a hearing with the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge two decisions sending their cases back to state court."
