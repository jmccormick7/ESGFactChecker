The European Union Aviation Safety Agency and Google announced Wednesday that they are partnering to develop a reliable framework for measuring the emissions' impact of flights flown by different airlines, and a way to present these calculations so flyers can make environmentally conscious choices.\n   Critics have argued that Google's current display of flight emissions greatly underestimate their environmental impact because they exclude contrails. The partnership will help Google and partners develop its Travel Impact Model, a framework for measuring flight emissions per passenger that's publicly accessible."

The new language model is part of a wider Google initiative to build a model for 1,000 global languages, said Gupta.
